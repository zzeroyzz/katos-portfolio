# 🎮 Kato's Retro Portfolio 🎨

Welcome to **Kato's Portfolio** – a retro-styled web application built with **React** and **Chakra UI**! This project showcases my work, services, and passion for 8-bit games 🕹️, all wrapped in a pixel-perfect design that throws back to the old-school gaming vibes.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project was created with **React** and styled using **Chakra UI**. It features draggable windows, inspired by the retro 90s desktop experience, and interactive elements like a **Snake Game** 🐍! The interface brings out a vintage, yet modern aesthetic for my portfolio.

## 🌟 Features
- **Responsive Design** 📱: Works smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Draggable Windows** 💻: Each window (Portfolio, Services, Contact, etc.) can be moved around the screen.
- **Snake Game** 🐍: Take a break and play the classic Snake game right in the portfolio!
- **Cool Animations** ✨: Smooth animations and transitions to enhance the retro gaming feel.
- **Z-Index Management** 🔄: Custom hook to manage the layering of windows.
- **Shut Down** 🔌: Refresh the page with a 'Shut Down' menu item.
